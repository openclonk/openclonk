# Intro
MsgIntro1=Wow, it's very turbulent here...
MsgIntro2=Have a look at that lava lake!
MsgIntro3=Come on old girl, hang in there...
MsgIntro4=Uh oh...
MsgIntro5=Quick! The ejection seats!
MsgIntro6=Phew, that was close.
MsgIntro7=What can we do now?
MsgIntro8=I think I saw the plane crash into the hill on the other side of the volcano.
MsgIntro9=The earth is soft on that hill. Maybe if you get there, you can still salvage the plane.
MsgIntro10=I will try my best

# NPC Pilot
MsgCrashedPlane=So, have you found the plane yet?
AnsCrashedPlane=No, we're still searching.
PyritQPlane=Where is the plane?
PyritAPlane=I think I saw it crash into the snow on the hill on the other side of the volcano.
PyritQLake=How can I cross the lake
PyritALake=You probably need some advanced tools. Maybe the villagers can give us something.
PyritQDone=Nevermind.

# NPC Merchant
Merchant1=Greetings, strangers from the sky. How can I help you?
MerchantQPlane=Have you seen our plane?
MerchantAPlane1=The strange bird? It flew over the turublent volcano and landed on the other side in the snow.
MerchantAPlane2=Getting there might not be that easy.
MerchantQLake=Can you help us cross the lake?
MerchantSellPlans=I know some interesting construction plans, which may help you in this situation. I can share them with you for 150 clunkers.
MerchantNoMoney=Then I'll have to mine for gold, I'll be back later.
MerchantBuyPlans=That's a good deal, here you go.
MerchantGivePlans=Thanks, here are the plans for {{Pump}}, {{Pipe}}, {{Catapult}} and {{Cannon}}.
MerchantQPump=How do I use the pump?
MerchantAPump1=Just use two pipes as you're standing in front of the pump. The first pipe becomes the source pipe from which is pumped and the second pipe is the drain.
MerchantAPump2=Then just throw the source pipe into liquid and the drain pipe to where you want to pump!
MerchantQCatapult=Why do I need the catapult?
MerchantACatapult1=A catapult has many uses. You can fling things like pipe ends. If you're daring, you could even try to catapult yourself over the lava lake!
MerchantACatapult2=That...sounds scary. I like it!
MerchantQGold=How do I get clunkers?
MerchantAGold=Blast gold nuggets {{Nugget}} out of the gold mine below. Then build a flagpole {{Flagpole}} and put nuggets into it. You'll get more clunkers by melting it to bars {{GoldBar}} in a foundry {{Foundry}} before.
MerchantQDone=Goodbye.

# Gyro
Gyro1=That's a weird spot for a clonk to stand in.
Gyro2=Yeah, I know! I'm here at this weird place because one of my experiments went horribly wrong...
Gyro3=What happend?
Gyro4=You see, fuel has gotten pretty rare and expensive recently. To save money, I tried to reach remote places by launching myself with a catapult!
Gyro5=That sounds pretty dangerous.
Gyro6=Bah, if your aim is good, you can just hop into a catapult and off you go! It's a really good way to reach distant locations quickly. Only a few people seem to know this secret! And even fewer actually do it!
Gyro7=I wonder why...
Gyro8=Well, to be fair... it is pretty dangerous. I almost flung myself into the lava lake because I couldn't find my glasses. Fortunately I missed it by just a few inches and landed here.
Gyro9=Stubbed my toe pretty bad though. Should have put on my safety-sandals...

# Outro
Outro1=It's done! The plane is back.
Outro2=Good job. Let's continue our voyage then. We still have a long way ahead of us.
Outro3=But next time we fly a bit higher, ok?
Outro4=I'll see what I can do.
