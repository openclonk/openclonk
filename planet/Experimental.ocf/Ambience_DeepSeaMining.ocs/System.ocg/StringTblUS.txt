Intro1=Pyrit, why do we have to fly in the clouds?
Intro2=You told me to fly higher after we almost crashed into the volcano.
Intro3=It's horribly turbulent in here.
Intro4=That's because water condensation in the cloud frees up energy which heats up the air.
Intro5=Thanks for the lecture. Now can we please fly lower again?
Intro6=First it's too turbulent when i fly low over the volcano and now it's too turbulent when i fly up high in the clouds.
Intro7=Why don't you just steer the plane yourself?
Intro8=...
Intro9=Alright. Let's swap places.
Intro10=Aaaah

Intro20=Ouch.
Intro21=Oh, a friend has fallen from the sky. Hello friend! My name is Tuesday.
Intro22=Damn. Have you seen our airplane? I accidentally dropped out of it.
Intro23=The sky is always cloudy here. We won't see any planes and planes won't see us.
Intro24=Ugh. But i need Pyrit to find me somehow.
Intro25=What lands on the island stays on the island. Just like me.
Intro26=Isn't there any way we could make a fire or something?
Intro27=Fire? That will do no good. Coconut wood doesn't burn well and it won't be seen through the clouds.
Intro28=But...we could use my <c ffff00>crystal communicator</c>!
Intro29=Sounds good. Where is it?
Intro30=I'm happy on this island. Why should i build a communication device? I've made plans but I haven't bothered to finish building it.
Intro31=The site and plans how to finish it are at the eastern end of this island. It just needs some metal and some gems.
Intro32=Metal sounds easy enough? Where can I find the gems?
Intro33=The fish sometimes talk about gem reserves deep below the ocean ground. Maybe you can mine those?
Intro34=Fish talk to you?
Intro35=If you listen carefully, even coconuts talk!
Intro36=Okay...i'll see if i can finish this construction.

Tuesday1=Hello, friend. How can I help you?
TuesdayQCommunicator=How do I use the communicator?
TuesdayACommunicator=Just bring the necessery materials to the construction site. It should work automatically when completed.
TuesdayQGems=Where can I find gems?
TuesdayAGems=Try to dive underground.
TuesdayQFish=Can you tell the fish to go away?
TuesdayAFish=I'm a listener. I do not force restraints onto the free creatures of this world.
TuesdayQWater=The water is too deep. How can I reach the gems?
TuesdayAWater=You could try and build wall kits{{WallKit}} in the tools workshop{{ToolsWorkshop}}. Wall kits can be used to construct stable walls under water protect you from fish and give some room to breath.
TuesdayAWater2=Using wall kits and a pump, you might be able to solve your problems.
TuesdayQBye=Bye

Outro1=The machine is done! I wonder whether it works.
Outro2=Looks good. Let's send a rescue signal...
Outro3=I wonder if anyone has heard us.
Outro4=Hey, isn't that our stranded friends?
Outro5=Hooray, we're saved!
Outro6=Hop on everyone, we're heading for the Golden Mountain!
