MsgTutorialWipfville=This guidepost reads Wipfville, probably the reason why Roger ran off. It seems that this little village has been under attack, maybe you can find out more by talking to that lumberjack over there. Stand in front of an NPC and press [%s] to start a conversation.
MsgTutorialFindRock=Okay, we need to find some rock to finish the construction of this sawmill over here. Let's have a look at the mines of this village, maybe we can find something there.
MsgTutorialDynamiteLorry=There is a lorry filled with dynamite. You can access the contents of many vehicles and buildings by pressing [%s], which opens the interaction menu. You can interchange items between different containers by clicking them. Grab a stick of dynamite!
MsgTutorialBlastRock=Perfect, with dynamite you can blast the rock at the ceiling, rock is used as a construction material. Hang onto the rock material and select one of the dynamite sticks, press [%s] once to fuse it and press it another time in the direction of the rock to stick it into the wall. Then jump off and run!
MsgTutorialPickUpRock=Great, pick up three pieces of rock, so that you can finish the sawmill construction. Note that the explosion could have flung some pieces of rock into the lorry.
MsgTutorialSawmill=Go up to the sawmill construction site and put the three pieces of rock into construction site via the interaction menu (press [%s] to open). If all building materials are put into a construction site, the building will be constructed automatically.
MsgTutorialTalkToFireman=The villagers seem to need a little more help, talk to the fireman standing next to the burned hut and to the builder next to the mine entrance.
MsgTutorialConstructFlagpole=Get the hammer from the chest, then use it by pressing [%s] to open the construction menu. From the construction menu you can select a building you wish to construct, select the flagpole and place it at the indicated position.
MsgTutorialFlagpoleMaterials=Now that the construction site is placed we need some wood and metal. Talk to the lumberjack again to obtain some wood.
MsgTutorialAxeChopping=Find the axe in the mine and use it chop down a tree for wood, then put three pieces of wood into the construction site for the flagpole. Stand next to a tree and use the axe to start chopping, be sure to not stand exactly in front of it and keep holding down the mouse button. The fallen tree can either be pushed into the sawmill or chopped to wood manually.
MsgTutorialOreMining=Good, now only one piece of metal is needed to finish the flagpole. This can be produced at the foundry using ore and coal. Descend into the mine again and get one piece of ore by blasting the ore material and one piece of coal by digging the coal material.
MsgTutorialProduceMetal=With ore and coal you can smelt metal, which is used as construction material for many structures and items. Go to the foundry and open the interaction menu by pressing [%s] to transfer the coal and ore to the foundry. For production facilities like the foundry there is an additional section in the interaction menu, select metal production here and wait for it to finish.
MsgTutorialMetalToSite=The metal is finished, pick it up and put it into the flagpole construction site to finish the flagpole.
MsgTutorialCompleted=Well done! You have mastered the basics of construction, using rock, wood and metal. The villagers of Wipfville will be grateful. Let's proceed to the next tutorial.
