  Frozen Fortress

Two rival fortresses are fighting in these unfavourable surroundings.

Goal: Steal your enemies' flag and bring it to your base (your flag has to be in your base)!

- Three useful spells, bound into scrolls, may help you.
- The chests are frequently restocked with weapons and other useful stuff.
- The geyser in the middle of the map erupts almost once a minute.
- Because it is so cold here, you cannot dig through the ice, however, you can destroy it with explosives.
- The gates open automatically when a friendly clonk comes within range.
