/**
	Power Consumer
	Handles some aspects of power consuming structures, this library should be
	included by	all power consuming structures. Certain functions should be 
	overloaded and others can be used to implement the consumption of power in
	a uniform way consistent with the network, see text below.
	
	The interfact is built up such that the consumer can make a request for power
	with the network by using the functions:
	 * RegisterPowerRequest(int amount)
	 * UnregisterPowerRequest()
	 * UpdatePowerRequest() - used internally only.
	The network will then continously search for available power to deliver to
	this consumer and will notify it via the callbacks
	 * OnEnoughPower(int amount)
	 * OnNotEnoughPower()
	The last callback will be called when the consumer had enough power and the 
	network stopped delivering to this consumer, due to whatever reason except 
	the consumer itself unregistering the request for power.
	
	The consumer structures can overload the function GetConsumerPriority() and
	return the priority for power requests. The library will deliver power 
	preferentially to consumers with higher priority. In this way certain 
	consumers can be prioritized over others. Typical return values are:
	 * Pump       25
	 * Workshop:  50
	 * Elevator: 100	 
	See also the scripts of these structures for more details on the usage of the
	power consumer library.	
	
	Using the callback GetActualPowerConsumer() the power consumption of an object
	can be passed to its main structure.
	
	The consumer does not consume power if the Rule_NoPowerNeed is active, to set 
	the need for power on a per consumer basis you can use the function 
	SetNoPowerNeed(bool no_need).
	
	Important notes when including this library:
	 * The object including this library should return _inherited(...) in the
	   Initialize and Destruction callback if overloaded.
