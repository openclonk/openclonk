/*--
	Stackable
	Author: Newton
	
	Including this object means, the object is stackable. Other objects of
	the same type will be added automatically to the object. This functionality
	is similar to the Pack-functionality of the arrows in old clonk titles only
	more general.
	The count of how many objects are stacked together (into a single one, this
	one) is shown in the picture of the object and can be queried and set via
	GetStackCount()/SetStackCount().
	To take one object of the stack, call TakeObject(). As long
	as the object exists, one can always take an object, even if it is the last
	one (self). This object is always outside.
	Infinite stackable count can by achieved using SetInfiniteStackCount.
	
	On entrance (or to be more precise: on RejectEntrance), it will be checked
	if the entering stackable object can be distributed over the other objects
	of the same ID. If yes, this object is deleted and the other object(s) will
	have a higher stack-count.
	
	Example 1:
	'15x Arrow' is about to enter a clonk which has '5x Arrow'. 15 will be added
	to the stack-count of the clonks '5x Arrow'-object (making it '20x Arrow'),
	the entering object will be deleted.
	
	Example 2:
	'17x Arrow' is about to enter a clonk which has '15x Arrow' and a bow with
	'10x Arrow' in it's ammunition slot. 10 will be added to the stack-count
	of the arrows in the bow, 5 to the stack-count of the arrows in the clonk
	(assuming MaxStackCount() is 20) and the original arrows-object will have
	2 arrows left. If there is an inventory slot left, the '2x Arrow" object
	will enter the clonk.
	
	Most objects which can be stacked might want to set different pictures
	and ingame graphics for different counts of objects. This can be done
	by overloading UpdatePicture(), but remember to write _inherited(...) then.
