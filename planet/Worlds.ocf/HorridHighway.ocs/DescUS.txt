Horrid Highway

Amidst the territory of the Skylanders there is an essential passage endangered by meteor strikes. The Skylanders have settlements on many of the sky islands and have roaring mining and industry. An essential part of their society is the train line that connects all main islands. In return for part of their wealth you must help to set up the last part of the tracks where protection from meteor showers is far from trivial. 

Goal: Construct and protect the locomotive highway.

Hints:
- There are infinite sources of rock, coal, ore and water on the left and right island.
- You need a set up transport lines to get the necessary resources.
- Use the switch to signify that the train line is ready.
- To fulfill the goal a number of trains need to pass the line.
